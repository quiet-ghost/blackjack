# Security Implementation

## Overview
The Blackjack Casino application has been upgraded with enterprise-grade security features to protect user data and ensure safe authentication.

## Security Features

### 🔐 Password Security
- **Bcrypt Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds (industry standard)
- **Password Strength Requirements**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Must contain at least one number
  - Must contain at least one special character
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text

### 🛡️ Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All user data is encrypted using Fernet (AES 128)
- **Secure Key Management**: Encryption keys are stored separately with restricted permissions
- **Data Integrity**: Encrypted storage prevents unauthorized data modification

### 🔒 Session Management
- **Secure Session Tokens**: 32-byte URL-safe tokens generated using `secrets` module
- **Session Expiry**: Sessions automatically expire after 1 hour of inactivity
- **Session Refresh**: Active sessions can be refreshed to extend validity
- **Automatic Logout**: Invalid sessions trigger automatic logout

### 🚫 Attack Prevention
- **Account Lockout**: Accounts are locked for 5 minutes after 5 failed login attempts
- **Brute Force Protection**: Progressive delays and lockouts prevent password attacks
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Case-Insensitive Login**: Usernames are case-insensitive but stored with original case

### 📁 File Security
- **Restricted Permissions**: Database files have 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
- **Encrypted Storage**: User data file (`secure_users.enc`) is fully encrypted
- **Secure Backup**: Old plain-text files are backed up before migration

## Migration from Old System

The application automatically migrates users from the old plain-text system:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Checks for old `users.json` file on startup
2. **Password Hashing**: Converts plain-text passwords to secure hashes
3. **Data Preservation**: Maintains all user statistics and chip balances
4. **Safe Backup**: Creates backup of old file before removal
5. **User Notification**: Informs users of successful security upgrade

## File Structure

```
database/
├── secure_users.enc    # Encrypted user data
├── .key               # Encryption key (restricted permissions)
└── users.json.backup  # Backup of old system (if migrated)
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication
- ✅ Strong password requirements
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ Account lockout protection
- ✅ Session management with expiry
- ✅ Secure session tokens

### Data Protection
- ✅ Encryption at rest (Fernet/AES)
- ✅ Secure key storage
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Restricted file permissions

### Application Security
- ✅ Session validation on data updates
- ✅ Automatic logout on session expiry
- ✅ Secure error handling
- ✅ Protection against common attacks
- ✅ Safe migration from legacy systems

## Testing

Run the security test suite:
```bash
python test_security.py
```

This validates:
- Password strength validation
- User registration and login
- Failed login protection
- Data encryption
- Session management
- File security

## Dependencies

Security libraries used:
- `bcrypt`: Password hashing
- `cryptography`: Data encryption
- `secrets`: Secure token generation

Install with:
```bash
pip install bcrypt cryptography
```

## Compliance

This implementation follows security best practices:
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Secure authentication and session management
- **Industry Standards**: Bcrypt with 12 rounds, AES encryption
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest, secure key management
- **Access Control**: Session-based authentication with expiry

## Future Enhancements

Potential security improvements:
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Password reset functionality
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting
- Database encryption with separate key management service
- OAuth integration
